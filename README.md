# Firebase Studio - Truck Tracker

This is a Next.js food truck finder application built in Firebase Studio. Its name is Truck Tracker.

To get started:
1.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
2.  Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
3.  Enable Email/Password Authentication in Firebase Authentication > Sign-in method.
4.  Create a Cloud Firestore database in Native Mode.
5.  In your Firebase project settings (General tab), find your Web app's SDK setup and configuration.
6.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of this project.
7.  Copy the contents of `.env.local.example` into `.env.local`.
8.  Replace the placeholder values in `.env.local` with your actual Firebase project credentials and your Google Maps API Key.
9.  Install dependencies: `npm install` (or `yarn install`).
10. Run the development server: `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`).

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:9002` (or your configured port).
The app, Truck Tracker, helps users find food trucks.
